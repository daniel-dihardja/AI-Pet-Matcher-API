# AI Pet Query

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to query and summarize pet information. It leverages OpenAI's language model, LangChain, and MongoDB to provide detailed and relevant information about pets based on user inputs. The application is built using AWS Lambda, Docker, and AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
