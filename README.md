# AI Pet Query API

This project is an API designed to query and summarize pet information for a web application. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques using OpenAI's language model, LangChain, and MongoDB to provide detailed and relevant information about pets based on user inputs. The application is built using AWS Lambda, Docker, and AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

Pet shelters can integrate this API into their web applications to find suitable matches for potential adopters based on the content of their emails, helping to streamline the adoption process and ensure pets are matched with appropriate homes.
